 Automation testing of trademe
 
 Web UI car details test (incomplete):
    todo:
        retrieve html document.
        Search document for information using tags/string search/external library functions (selinium?) to see if correct text displaying.
        May be difficult to verify information is being displayed (not just hidden in code) without use of external libraries.
        
 Charity API search (complete):
    String being searched for can be changed by altering code in main method.
 
 Car details API test (incomplete):
    todo:
        Use "GET v1/Listings/{listingId}" to retrieve listing xml.
        Need to find method of retrieving authorisation tokens (know how to generate OAuth keys). Useful resource: http://boye1024.blogspot.com/2016/01/trade-me-api-oauth-java-example.html.
        Pull information out of xml in way to Charity API search.
